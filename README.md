 #    Problem Statement 
Is not it nice to have a device that lights your room to turn on and turn off the lights in your room when you go out or enter the room?
For my final project, I will use the PIR Sensor to detect any movement occurring in a 20-foot orbit, which can monitor movement from 20 feet. I will also use the Relay to connect room lamps, for example, in order for Relay to control the power of the lights. And of course the Arduino, which is the heart of the project, I will program it to accomplish its mission successfully. Maybe I will be able also to improve it to do a security device against theft, or a device that runs your favourite music while in the room.

   #  How to connect this project
   
   1-Connect the 5volt port on the Arduino to the power outlets on the side of the breadboard and the
 Gnd port on the Arduino on the negative power outlets on the breadboard as

2-Connect the positive power cord of the sensor to the 5 v port on the breadboard, and the negative power cord to
Gnd port on the breadboard. Plug the Signal cable into port 9 on the card

3-Connect the reel power cord to the 5 v port on the breadboard, and the negative power cord to the
Gnd port on the breadboard.Connect the signal cable to port 10 on the card.

#  The programming text is written as follows:

When the motion sensor detects any movement in its surroundings, it activates the LED and the relay
 to connect the power source to the braille-ready supply. Arduino code and c# code on my Github account

#  Future Work:


This is a great starting point for future work with this project. I will be able also to improve it to do
 a security device against theft, or a device that runs your favourite music while in the room. , etc.
 In conjunction with software from other groups this project could be almost fully automated and controlled
